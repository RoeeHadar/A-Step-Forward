# BLOCKED — items the Release Captain cannot complete autonomously

The Release Captain (this chat) executed everything that can be done from
inside the workspace: merge train, governance files, marketing copy, diagrams,
smoke scripts, CI hardening. Below is the **closed list of human-only actions**
required to get from the current state (`release/phase-1-integration` ready for
review) to a launched, public site.

Each item is independently actionable. You can knock them out in any order
within a phase. Estimated total wall-clock if you have an evening: **2.5–4 h**.

---

## 0. One-time prereqs

These tools are needed to drive the rest.

**Installed by Release Captain:**
- [x] GitHub CLI (`gh`) — v2.95
- [x] Node 20+ — v24.17
- [x] pnpm 9.12 — via npm, global bin at `%APPDATA%\Local\pnpm`
- [x] uv — v0.11.23
- [x] flyctl — v0.4.60 (at `%USERPROFILE%\.fly\bin`)
- [x] Vercel CLI — v54.15.1 (via pnpm global)
- [x] Doppler CLI — v3.76.0 (binary at `%USERPROFILE%\.doppler`)

**Auth status:**
- [x] `gh` — authenticated (keyring token with all scopes)
- [x] `vercel` — authenticated as `roeehadar`
- [ ] `flyctl auth login` — still needs browser flow (for API + workers deploy)
- [ ] `doppler login` — still needs browser flow (secrets manager)

**WSL:**
- [x] `wsl --install` run — restart still pending to activate Docker Desktop

## 2. Provision managed services (45–60 min)

All hosting decisions are locked in `RESUME-README.md` and `09-infra-resume.md`.
Each provider has a free tier sufficient for launch traffic.

Push everything into Doppler:

doppler login
doppler projects create a-step-forward
doppler configs create dev --project a-step-forward
doppler configs create stg --project a-step-forward
doppler configs create prd --project a-step-forward
# then doppler secrets set KEY=VAL --project a-step-forward --config <env>
```

Generate service tokens for CI and store them as GitHub Actions secrets at
`https://github.com/RoeeHadar/A-Step-Forward/settings/secrets/actions`:

- `DOPPLER_TOKEN_STG`, `DOPPLER_TOKEN_PRD` (service tokens per env).
- `VERCEL_TOKEN`, `VERCEL_ORG_ID`, `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`.
- `FLY_API_TOKEN`.
- `STAGING_DATABASE_URL`, `PRODUCTION_DATABASE_URL` (for migration jobs).

> The existing `.github/workflows/deploy-*.yml` already reference these names.

## 3. First staging deploy + smoke ✅ DONE

**Live URL: https://a-step-forward-waij.vercel.app**

Smoke results (Release Captain, 2026-06-24):
- ✓ `/` — 200
- ✓ `/api/health` — 200
- ✓ `/sign-in` — 200
- ✓ `/sign-up` — 200

Remaining in this step:
- [ ] Walk through `apps/web/e2e/chat-flow.spec.ts` against the live URL to verify
      sign-up → chat → memory flow end-to-end.
- [ ] Generate a 30–60s demo GIF (Loom or [Cap](https://cap.so/)) and drop it as
      `docs/marketing/demo.gif`. Reference it from the README hero.

---

## 4. Tangled WIP branch ✅ DONE

Split by the Release Captain into three clean branches and PRs:
- [PR #2](https://github.com/RoeeHadar/A-Step-Forward/pull/2) — `chore/infra/workspace-stabilization`
- [PR #3](https://github.com/RoeeHadar/A-Step-Forward/pull/3) — `feat/agents/03-phase3-system-agents`
- [PR #4](https://github.com/RoeeHadar/A-Step-Forward/pull/4) — `feat/mcp/05-server-improvements`

---

## 5. Promote to prod + custom domain (20 min)

- [ ] Buy `astepforward.app` at Cloudflare Registrar (or accept Vercel default).
- [ ] In Vercel: add custom domain, copy CNAME to Cloudflare DNS.
- [ ] In Cloudflare: turn off proxy for Vercel CNAME, on for any apex `A` record.
- [ ] Run `gh workflow run deploy-prod.yml -f confirm=promote` from `main`.
- [ ] Re-run smoke against prod.

---

## 6. Flip repo public + enable community surfaces (10 min)

After Phase-C bars are met (smoke green, Sentry < 0.5%, p95 < 2.5s, evals
green for ≥ 24h):

- [ ] `gh repo edit RoeeHadar/A-Step-Forward --visibility public --accept-visibility-change-consequences`
- [ ] `gh repo edit --enable-discussions --enable-issues`
- [ ] Enable Dependabot:
      `https://github.com/RoeeHadar/A-Step-Forward/settings/security_analysis`
      → turn on Dependabot alerts, security updates, version updates, secret
      scanning.
- [ ] Enable private vulnerability reporting on the same page.
- [ ] Add the topics: `ai`, `education`, `learning`, `agents`, `memory`,
      `graphrag`, `nextjs`, `fastapi`, `langgraph`.

---

## 7. Marketing (15 min)

Copy is already drafted under `docs/marketing/`:

- [ ] Generate hero illustration (`docs/assets/hero.png`) — the Release Captain
      attempted via `GenerateImage` but you may want to regenerate / replace.
- [ ] Generate OG card (`docs/assets/og-card.png`) — wired into `apps/web` via
      `apps/web/src/app/layout.tsx` metadata. Confirm both Twitter card and OG
      tags resolve to the right asset on Vercel.
- [ ] Post `docs/marketing/launch-hn.md` to https://news.ycombinator.com/submit
      between 8–11am ET Tue/Wed/Thu (best traffic).
- [ ] Post `docs/marketing/launch-ph.md` to https://www.producthunt.com — set
      "launching tomorrow" 24h before 00:01 PT.
- [ ] Post the LinkedIn + Twitter thread from `docs/marketing/social-copy.md`.

---

## 8. Nice-to-have, post-launch (defer if tight on time)

- [ ] MCP server Fly apps (`asf-mcp-memory`, `asf-mcp-graphrag`,
      `asf-mcp-curriculum`, `asf-mcp-progress`) — add `infra/fly/asf-mcp-*.toml`
      and matching deploy job. Currently MCP servers run in-process / locally.
- [ ] Memory Phase-2 (real Postgres + pgvector backed memory_service) — stream
      04 owner.
- [ ] Backend Phase-2 (Clerk JWT verification, rate limits, schema codegen
      from Python → TS) — stream 02 owner.
- [ ] Curriculum seed expansion beyond the math fractions example.
- [ ] Evals expansion (per-agent thresholds, retrieval evals coverage).

**PRs open:**
- [#1](https://github.com/RoeeHadar/A-Step-Forward/pull/1), [#2](https://github.com/RoeeHadar/A-Step-Forward/pull/2), [#3](https://github.com/RoeeHadar/A-Step-Forward/pull/3), [#4](https://github.com/RoeeHadar/A-Step-Forward/pull/4)

**Governance + docs:**
- `LICENSE` (MIT), `SECURITY.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `cliff.toml`.
- `.github/workflows/changelog.yml`, `.github/workflows/repo-health.yml`.
- `docs/adr/README.md` (ADR index).
- `docs/marketing/copy.md`, `launch-hn.md`, `launch-ph.md`, `social-copy.md`.
- `docs/diagrams/architecture.md`, `docs/diagrams/graphrag.md`.
- `scripts/smoke/e2e.sh`, `scripts/smoke/e2e.ps1`.
- README polished with hero image, badges, agent matrix.

**CLIs installed:**
- pnpm 9.12 · flyctl 0.4.60 · Vercel CLI 54.15.1 · Doppler CLI 3.76.0

**Code validated locally:**
- `ruff check .` — all checks passed.
- `ruff format .` — 9 scripts files reformatted.
- `mypy` — no issues (fixed `DeclarativeBase` type annotation in `infra/alembic/env.py`)
- `pnpm install` — succeeded (peer warnings for react 19 in Clerk/shadcn are pre-existing, not blocking).
- Alembic migration validation skipped — Docker Desktop requires WSL (see §0).

When every box above is checked, delete this file in the commit titled
`chore: launched 🚀`.
